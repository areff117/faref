        <p>Profile and academic focus</p>
      </div>

      <p class="lead">
        I study how societies evolve by integrating computational sociology, mixed methods research,
        and policy analysis to investigate how structural forces shape the trajectories and
        reproduction of inequality across contexts and over time.
      </p>

      <p>
        My work connects sociological theory with comparative data, focusing on social inequality,
        labor markets, welfare regimes, migration, education, and health disparities. I work across
        survey research, community development, and public policy, with a consistent emphasis on
        methodological transparency and public relevance.

      <h3>Research philosophy and impact</h3>
      <p>
        I study how systems of inequality are built, reproduced, and sometimes dismantled.
        My work integrates sociological theory with computational and mixed methods analysis
        to connect data with lived experience. Projects are designed so that findings are
        interpretable and usable for agencies, organizations, and interdisciplinary teams.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        At the core of my work is a commitment to human dignity and to building evidence
        that can support fairer institutions and more equitable policy.

      <h3>Teaching philosophy</h3>
      <p>
        My teaching is shaped by a broad academic formation across sociology, community development,
        public policy, and empirical research. I encourage students to see how institutions,
        labor markets, and policy structures shape inequality in everyday life, and to develop
        both technical skills and critical sociological imagination.
